# Local Configuration Guide

This guide configures and runs the `school_management` addon in the local Odoo 19 workspace on Windows.

## 1. Confirm the prerequisites

Use PowerShell from `C:\Odoo\odoo` and confirm that these components are available:

- PostgreSQL is running and accepts connections on `localhost:5432`.
- The PostgreSQL role `odoo` exists. The current local configuration uses an empty password.
- The repository virtual environment exists at `C:\Odoo\odoo\venv`.
- wkhtmltopdf is installed at `C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin` if PDF reports are required.

Check the Python environment:

```powershell
Set-Location C:\Odoo\odoo
& .\venv\Scripts\python.exe --version
```

The addon is designed for Odoo 19. Do not use a different Odoo checkout or Python environment without also reviewing the dependency and configuration differences.

## 2. Review the Odoo configuration

The repository already contains [`odoo.conf`](../../../odoo.conf). Its important local values are:

```ini
db_name = odoo
db_host = localhost
db_port = 5432
db_user = odoo
addons_path = C:\Odoo\odoo\addons,C:\Odoo\odoo\odoo\addons,C:\Odoo\odoo\custom
http_port = 8070
```

The configuration also restricts Odoo to the `odoo` database with `dbfilter = ^odoo$` and hides the database selector with `list_db = False`. Keep the `admin_passwd` value private; it controls database-management operations and is separate from the normal Odoo administrator login.

If your PostgreSQL username, password, database name, or ports differ, update `odoo.conf` and the seed script connection settings before continuing.

## 3. Create or verify the database

List databases using the project environment:

```powershell
& .\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\odoo-bin db -c .\odoo.conf --list
```

If the `odoo` database does not exist, initialize it:

```powershell
& .\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\odoo-bin -c .\odoo.conf -d odoo -i base --stop-after-init
```

If this fails with a PostgreSQL authentication or connection error, fix PostgreSQL service status, role permissions, or the values in `odoo.conf` before installing the addon.

## 4. Install the addon

Install `school_management` into the `odoo` database:

```powershell
& .\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\odoo-bin -c .\odoo.conf -d odoo -i school_management --stop-after-init
```

The manifest loads the security groups, access rights, record rules, data, wizards, reports, views, menus, and backend assets. A successful command should finish with exit code `0`.

After installation, start the server:

```powershell
& .\start_odoo.ps1
```

The launcher adds wkhtmltopdf to `PATH` when it is installed. Open [http://localhost:8070/web/login](http://localhost:8070/web/login) in a browser.

## 5. Load optional sample data

The module can be used with manually entered records. For a populated local demonstration database, load the SQL seed after the module has been installed:

```powershell
Set-Location C:\Odoo\odoo
& .\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\custom\school_management\seed\run_seed.py
```

The script connects to `localhost:5432`, database `odoo`, as PostgreSQL user `odoo`. It is intentionally not part of the Odoo module install process. Do not run it against production data.

The seed uses fixed IDs and `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING`, so rerunning it does not replace existing records. If the database schema has changed or the seed references missing tables, upgrade the module first and inspect the error before retrying.

## 6. Configure users and roles

The addon defines School User, Student, Teacher, HOD, Dean, and School Admin groups. Record rules scope access through the chain:

```text
res.users -> teacher_id -> teacher -> department/faculty
```

To configure a real user:

1. Log in as an administrator.
2. Open **Settings -> Users** and create or open a user.
3. Assign the appropriate school group(s).
4. For a teacher, HOD, or Dean, set the user’s `teacher_id` link to the matching teacher record.
5. For a Dean, ensure that the linked teacher is the dean of the intended faculty.
6. Save, sign out, and test with the target user![img.png](img.png) account.

The verified local demo accounts are documented in [`test_credentials.md`](test_credentials.md). Change those passwords before sharing the database or exposing the server beyond the local machine.

Use the application menus in this order so required relationships are available:

1. **Structure**: faculties, departments, programs, subjects, and classrooms.
2. **Academic**: academic years, semesters, and semester subjects.
3. **Teachers** and **Students**.
4. **Academic**: class sections and academic assignments.
5. **Enrollment**: enroll students into class sections, either directly or through the enrollment wizard.
6. **Finance**: create fee invoices, add fee lines, post the invoice, then create and post payments.

For finance testing, a payment must have a positive amount. If a fee is linked, its student must match the payment student. Posted and canceled payments are protected from direct edits.

## 8. Verify the installation

Check these application areas while logged in as the administrator:

- The **Dashboard** opens and displays student, teacher, department, enrollment, fee, and payment KPIs.
- The **Structure**, **Academic**, **Students**, **Teachers**, **Enrollment**, and **Finance** menus are visible.
- A payment receipt can be generated from a posted payment.
- A curriculum report can be opened from the relevant academic records.
- A teacher, HOD, Dean, and Student user can only see the records allowed by their assigned role and links.

Run the focused addon tests when the database is available:

```powershell
& .\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\odoo-bin -c .\odoo.conf -d odoo --test-enable -i school_management --stop-after-init
```

For a code-only upgrade followed by the tests, use:

```powershell
& .\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\odoo-bin -c .\odoo.conf -d odoo -u school_management --test-enable --stop-after-init
```

## 9. Upgrade after code changes

Stop the running Odoo server, then upgrade the addon:

```powershell
Set-Location C:\Odoo\odoo
& .\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\odoo-bin -c .\odoo.conf -d odoo -u school_management --stop-after-init
```

Start Odoo again with `& .\start_odoo.ps1`. If browser assets appear stale after JavaScript or SCSS changes, reload the page with the browser’s hard-refresh action or start Odoo with the relevant asset-development options used by your workflow.

## Troubleshooting

### `school_management` is not found

Confirm that `C:\Odoo\odoo\custom` is present in `addons_path`, then update the module list from the Apps screen or restart Odoo and repeat the install command.

### PostgreSQL connection fails

Confirm the PostgreSQL service is running, the `odoo` role can connect to database `odoo`, and `db_host`, `db_port`, `db_user`, and `db_password` match the local server.

### The database selector or database manager is unavailable

This is expected with `list_db = False` and the locked `dbfilter`. Use the configured `odoo` database, or temporarily change those settings only for controlled local administration.

### A role sees too many or too few records

Check the user’s assigned groups and `teacher_id` first. Also verify the teacher’s department, faculty, HOD status, and dean assignment. Sign out and back in after changing access groups.

### A report fails to render

Install wkhtmltopdf and verify that `C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin` exists. The supplied `start_odoo.ps1` adds that directory to `PATH`.
